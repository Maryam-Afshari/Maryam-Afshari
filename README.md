### career
I have been working as a researcher in Iran for 5 years.  I was engaged in serious social sciences projects as well as giving consultants to students writing their thesis. Everything started from being chosen as the excellent thesis proposal by the medical university of Isfahan. My proposal was fully funded by the university. Afterwards, I made my career as a freelance researcher. You can read the result of a couple of projects I have done here: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jdr/2018/9353858/

In meanwhile, I was a tour guide in my majestic home town; Isfahan. Being a guide taught me about different cultures and how to cope with diffrent people in diffrent situations. 
In 2020 I did a boot camp in data science in Amsterdam and I am currently a data science master student in Utrecht. I am doing my thesis on "Building a deep network model to predict river discharge using meteorological forcing"
